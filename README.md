# About

**Repo Name:** mycoReactor

## Objective
Control and monitor a heating pad system for precise temperature regulation using an Arduino, SHT30 temperature/humidity sensor, and MOSFET. Data is logged and visualized to optimize heater performance.

## Major Tasks
1. Read temperature and humidity from the SHT30 sensor.
2. Control a heating pad via IRL44N MOSFET based on target temperature.
3. Log system status to timestamped CSV files every 10 seconds.
4. Generate interactive web-based plots of temperature and humidity over time.

## Tools Used
- Arduino (Mega/Uno)
- SHT30 I2C temperature & humidity sensor
- IRL44N N-channel MOSFET
- Python (logging and website generation)
- Plotly.js for interactive plotting
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the dashboard

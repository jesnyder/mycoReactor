Evan stacked two placed two petri dished containing nearly pure mycellium on the heating pad, which had been warmed to 60 degC. The petri dishes were nearly pure mycellium than had to be dried for further analysis.

A timelapse was taken of one dish (the top dish) using a digital microscope (DinoLite) and companion software. Photos were taken every 5 minutes for 60 minutes (from 5:20 to 6:20).


In future studies, the petri dishes should have been weighed before and after drying.
